"""Patch a HiBy R1 Audiobook Mod firmware image so it loads the Podcasts app.

The app is an LD_PRELOAD library, and what loads it is /usr/bin/hiby_player.sh.
That file lives on a read-only squashfs, so it cannot be pushed to the device —
the firmware has to be repacked. This takes *your own* .upt, applies one patch
to that script, and writes a new .upt. No one else's firmware is redistributed.

    ./patch_firmware.py r1-audiobooks-2.0.26.upt r1-podcast-2.0.26.upt

Needs pycdlib (pip install pycdlib) and squashfs-tools (mksquashfs/unsquashfs).
Verified against the mod's 2.0.25 and 2.0.26 releases.

Image layout, worked out by inspection:

    /D0000001/F0000002.BIN   md5 of each rootfs chunk, one per line
    /D0000001/F0000003.BIN   the same for the kernel chunks
    /D0000001/F0000004.TXT   manifest: img_name / img_size / img_md5 per image
    /D0000001/F0000005.TXT   empty
    /D0000001/F0000006...    rootfs.squashfs, then xImage, in 512 KiB chunks
    /F00000NN.TXT            current_version=0, numbered after the last chunk

Both the manifest digests and the per-chunk digests have to be regenerated or
the device rejects the update.

#
# Stock bt_init spends ~12s in sleep(1): 1 after the rfkill write, 5 after
# brcm_patchram_plus, 1 after "hciconfig up", 1 after the reset, 2 after
# bt-agent, and 1 each around the alsa.conf write and the bt-adapter calls.
#
# Measured on hardware (LEAN_4, 2026-09-02), stock, from a cold boot:
#
#     rfkill0 present (cywdhd finished)   uptime  3.88s
#     hci0 present                        uptime  8.98s
#     /tmp/bt_init_ok                     uptime 16.29s
#
# So Bluetooth was not actually usable until 16.3s, and cywdhd -- the thing
# previously blamed for BT being late -- accounted for 0.44s of that, under
# 3%. The sleeps are the whole story.
#
# Each sleep below becomes "wait until the thing we were sleeping for is
# true", polling every 50ms, with a timeout. The timeout is the failure
# bound, not the normal path, so the worst case is no worse than stock's
# blind sleep and the normal case is much faster. Re-running the rewritten
# script on hardware, against a full rfkill power-cycle of the radio, it
# completes in 5.79s instead of ~12.4s with every milestone reached
# (bluetoothd, bt-agent and bluealsa all up, alias set, Hibylink SP
# registered, same "Powered 1 -> 0" end state).

       /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill0 -- the switch /usr/bin/bt_init writes to in
       order to power the radio. It is a combo chip and one driver owns power
       for both, so never loading it would silently kill Bluetooth.

    2. It does not move the line to the end of the script. That was tried and
       reverted: it works, and the UI does come up sooner, but Bluetooth then
       becomes available noticeably later, because rfkill0 only appears once
       the WiFi chip has finished initialising. Backgrounding in place starts

    checked for the expected vendor content first, so a firmware whose
    scripts differ is left alone rather than silently overwritten.

    They also serialise on a shared lock. The app backgrounds these on every
    tap, so a user tapping again because nothing visibly happened got a
    second copy racing the first over the single UDC -- observed live as
    three adboff invocations in three seconds, and adbon/adboff overlapping
    in the same second, leaving no gadget bound at all. Verified by firing
    five concurrent adboff and three concurrent adbon on hardware: four and
    two respectively logged "already in progress, ignoring", and the switch
    completed correctly both ways with the player still alive.

    Preferred path is a full umount: measured on hardware, library_standalone
    holds zero fds under the mount when idle, so it succeeds. The fallback is
    remount read-only, which still leaves the host as the only writer -- the
    property that actually prevents corruption -- for the case where a track

    Measured on hardware (LEAN_4, 2026-09-02): the dominant cost in bt_init is
    brcm_patchram_plus, which takes 4.26s before hci0 appears. That figure is
    *fixed* -- it was measured at --tosleep=50000, 20000, 10000 and 5000 and
    came back 4.25-4.26s every time, and the .hcd is only 46KB, so it is
    neither the per-command sleep nor the 3Mbaud transfer. It is the chip's own
    bring-up plus hardcoded delays inside brcm_patchram_plus, and we have no
    source for that binary. So it cannot be made shorter -- only started sooner.

    S80_bt_init already runs the script backgrounded ("$PL01 &"), so nothing
    downstream waits on it. Its real dependencies are:

      - /usr/data mounted, for bt_macaddr.txt and alsa.conf   -> S21mount_ubifs
      - rfkill0, i.e. cywdhd loaded                           -> S11, and the
        patched script now waits for the node rather than assuming it
      - /dev/ttyS0                                            -> kernel, always
      - its own dbus-daemon, which it starts itself           -> not S30dbus

    So S22 is the first slot where it can run, and moving it there overlaps

    The stock images carry both Joliet (level 3) and Rock Ridge 1.09. Omitting
    them still produces a valid ISO 9660 image that reads back perfectly on a
    host — every digest verifies — but the device's updater cannot navigate it:
    it displays "Upgrading..." and never progresses. The extensions shift where
    the payload starts (first chunk at extent 51 rather than 33), so this is not
    cosmetic. Anything changed here must be checked against a stock image with
    verify_firmware.py --against, not merely by confirming checksums.
