/* library.c — browsing the music library.
 *
 * Reads the stock index at /usr/data/usrlocal_media.db rather than scanning the
 * card again: it has already walked 176 GB, and it carries album_artist on
 * every row. What the stock browsing UI does with that is another matter — it
 * lists an album artist's individual tracks instead of their albums, which is
 * the reason this app exists.
 *
 * Two traps in that database, both found the hard way:
 *
 *  - Every string is NUL-terminated *inside the value*. Rows come back as
 *    'Ceremony\0'. A WHERE clause against 'Ceremony' matches nothing, and the
 *    stray byte renders as a box. Everything is trimmed on the way out and
 *    every lookup key is matched with LIKE 'x%' rather than =.
 *  - There is no track number. Only track_gain and track_peak, which are
 *    ReplayGain. The natural row order is alphabetical by title, so an album
 *    comes back in the wrong order. Ordering is recovered from the filename
 *    where it carries a number, and from the file's tags otherwise.
 *
 * Opened read-only: the stock scanner owns this file and may rewrite it.

/* BG11's actual cause, found from the device's own database, not guessed:
 * "In Time: The Best of R.E.M." has album_artist empty (a bare NUL, no
 * scanner-written tag at all — a real compilation-album gap, not
 * corruption) on every one of its 33 rows, while `artist` is correctly
 * "R.E.M." per track. `album_artist LIKE 'R.E.M.%'` then matches nothing —
 * a real artist name can never match an empty field — so the query below
 * returns zero rows, not 33 with stale paths, and the sweep fallback above
 * (n==0 && seed_path[0]) never gets a folder to sweep either. The only
 * reason this ever looked like it worked was an unrelated bug: reaching
 * this album via Albums directly left `cur_artist` empty (a `row->owner`
 * that is itself the same bare NUL), and an empty artist parameter turns
 * into a `%` wildcard that happens to match anything, including a blank
 * album_artist. That is a coincidence a stale cur_artist should not be
 * relied on for, not a fix.
 *
 * use_artist=1 tries the disambiguating filter first — needed when two
 * different artists share an album name and album_artist is populated.
 * use_artist=0 is the retry once that comes back with literally nothing to
 * work with, dropping the filter and matching by album alone.
 *
 * The artist match itself is deliberately two-directional, not a plain
 * "column starts with the tapped artist" LIKE: found live on a Schoenberg
 * box set where 34 of 37 tracks carry album_artist "Berliner Philharmoniker,
 * Kirill Petrenko" and the 3 Violin Concerto tracks add the soloist,
 * "...Kirill Petrenko, Patricia Kopatchinskaja". lib_albums()'s max(album_
 * artist) picks the longer string (lexicographically greater), so the row
 * tapped from Albums always carries the soloist's name -- and the old
 * one-directional "album_artist like 'tapped-value%'" then matched only
 * the 3 rows that actually start with that longer string, silently
 * dropping the other 34. The second clause below catches the reverse
 * case -- the tapped value starting with the row's own (shorter)
 * album_artist -- without weakening the filter for two genuinely
 * different artists sharing an album title (their names don't prefix one
 * another, so neither clause matches across them).
 *
 * substr(album_artist, 1, length(album_artist)-1), not album_artist itself,
 * on the right side of that second clause: this file's own header comment
 * on the stock DB's traps says every string carries a NUL *inside* the
 * value, not just as a terminator -- confirmed live, hex-dumped directly
 * off the Schoenberg rows: the 40-byte "short" album_artist is 39 real
 * bytes plus a trailing 0x00 (the 65-byte "long" one is 64 real bytes
 * plus the same). Appending '%' straight onto the raw column therefore
 * appended it *after* that embedded NUL, so the pattern demanded the
 * literal byte sequence "...Petrenko\0%" -- which the actual searched
 * value (a plain C string with no embedded NUL of its own) can never
 * contain, so the clause matched nothing at all despite being logically
 * correct. Dropping the last byte before appending '%' fixes it; verified
 * directly against a pulled copy of the real device database, 3 rows to
 * 37. (char(0)/rtrim(x, char(0)) were tried first and don't work here --
 * this build's char(0) reports length() 0, not 1, so neither rtrim() nor
 * replace() ever had a real NUL byte to strip.) */
/* BG91: tapping "Substance" (Joy Division) also played tracks from
 * "Substance 1987" (New Order), interleaved -- reported live, and visible
 * directly in music.log's own play sequence. Root cause: album was matched
 * with the exact same trailing-wildcard LIKE pattern (`album || '%'`)
 * artist/genre facets use deliberately, for a reason that doesn't apply to
 * album at all -- facets use a prefix match so a compound value like
 * "Berliner Philharmoniker, Kirill Petrenko" still matches on the shorter
 * "Berliner Philharmoniker" (see tracks_query()'s own header comment on the
 * album_artist half of this same function). An album title has no such
 * legitimate shorter/longer relationship to itself; "Substance" is simply a
 * different, unrelated album from "Substance 1987", and the wildcard
 * matched both. Fixed with exact equality instead of a prefix match, still
 * tolerating the stock DB's embedded-trailing-NUL quirk (this file's own
 * header comment) by comparing against both the plain value and the value
 * with one real NUL byte appended -- built in C with an explicit bind
 * length rather than SQL's char(0), which the album_artist comment above
