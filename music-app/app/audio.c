/* audio.c — decode to ALSA on a worker thread.
 *
 * Decoding is bundled, output is borrowed. The device's libsndfile looked like
 * the obvious answer and is not: it is built without libFLAC — links libc and
 * libm alone — so it rejects FLAC, which is 3943 of the 4722 tracks here. The
 * public-domain dr_libs decoders are compiled in instead, covering FLAC, MP3
 * and WAV, 96% of the library, with no device dependency at all. M4A is the
 * remaining 4%; libfdk-aac is on the device but needs an MP4 demuxer first.
 *
 * ALSA is still dlopen'd, so a missing libasound degrades to "no sound" rather
 * than the whole hook failing to load into hiby_player.
 *
 * Device constraints carried over from the Podcasts app, all learned the hard
 * way there:
 *
 *  - Open "plughw:0,0" so ALSA resamples to whatever discrete rates the
 *    hardware actually accepts; snd_pcm_set_params is unreliable here, so hw
 *    and sw params are set by hand.
 *  - The CS43131's volume registers are not wired: writes report success, read
 *    back 0 and change nothing. Wired output therefore scales samples in
 *    software. Bluetooth is different — bluealsa exposes a real mixer.
 *  - Join the worker on "a thread exists", not on "it is still running". The
 *    worker clears its own running flag as it exits, so keying the join off
 *    that flag skips it exactly when the thread has already finished, and the
 *    stack is then never reclaimed for the life of hiby_player.

 * start of the file up to the target (dr_mp3's own comment, not this app's).
 * mp3_seektable_kickoff() only starts building that table once a track is
 * already open, on its own background thread, and building it costs exactly
 * the same full-file decode pass -- so a resume seek landing anywhere close
 * to the end of a long episode, on the very first open, had no fast option
 * either way: minutes of silent 100%-of-one-core decode before anything was
 * audible, and if the user switched tracks while that was running,
 * audio_stop()'s pthread_join() froze the whole UI thread for the same
 * span, since nothing inside that single blocking call checks g_running.
 *
 * This sidesteps both by seeking approximately instead of exactly, the same
 * technique every mainstream MP3 player uses for an unindexed seek: scale
 * the target time by the file's average byte rate to land close in the
 * file, then let a fresh decoder resync from there. mp3_probe() already
 * reads the bitrate from the first real frame header for exactly this kind
 * of "close enough" estimate elsewhere in this file; for CBR (the common
 * case for a fixed-quality podcast export) it's exact, and for VBR it's
 * still within a fraction of a second per hour of drift, nowhere near
 * enough to be audible against spoken content. Landing a few frames short
 * or long of the mathematical target is an accepted, universal trade-off of
 * this technique -- not a bug -- because the alternative is the multi-minute
 * stall above.
 *

 * forward from wherever the stream currently sits (or from the very start,
 * for a backward seek) to reach the target, real decode work proportional
 * to how far into the file the target is, run synchronously inside the
 * seek call itself. That's why a deep seek -- including a skip button,
 * which is just a seek relative to the current position -- could stall the
 * worker thread, and with it the position clock and playback both, for
 * several seconds: "the bar jumps and then returns to its original
 * position" was actually the display freezing at the pre-seek value while
 * this ran, not a revert (confirmed by sequential screenshots after one
 * tap: frozen, then landed correctly, then continued forward with no
 * bounce back).
 *
 * dr_mp3 also supports binding a seek table (drmp3_bind_seek_table()) that
 * turns the same call into an O(1) lookup plus a small bounded decode
 * within one segment -- but building it costs a pass through the whole
 * file's frame headers first, cheap per frame but proportional to file
 * length, and a podcast episode runs long. Doing that synchronously at
 * track-open would trade "seeking is occasionally slow" for "starting
 * every track is slow", which is worse: most tracks are listened to start
 * to finish without ever being seeked.
 *
 * So it's built in the background, on its own detached thread, against a
 * *separate* drmp3 instance opened on the same file -- never touching the
 * live playback decoder directly, since dr_mp3 has no internal thread
 * safety of its own and the worker thread is continuously reading from it.
 * The finished table crosses threads as a single pointer handoff through
 * g_lock, and only the worker thread itself ever calls
 * drmp3_bind_seek_table() on its own decoder, from its own main loop,
 * alongside the other per-tick state it already checks there each pass.
 * If the track has changed by the time a build finishes, the result is
 * discarded rather than published (checked against g_path under the same
 * lock), so a background build for a track skipped a second after it
 * started can never clobber whatever the *current* track is doing. */
