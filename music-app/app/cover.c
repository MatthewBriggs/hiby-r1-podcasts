/* cover.c — feed cover art: JPEG decode to RGB565, cached on the card.
 *
 * The device ships libjpeg 9 (/usr/lib/libjpeg.so.9) but no headers, and it is
 * dlopen'd rather than linked so a missing or mismatched library degrades to
 * "no cover" instead of failing to load the app. That means the struct layout
 * has to be described here, which is why libjpeg 9's own headers are vendored:
 * jpeg_CreateDecompress validates sizeof(struct jpeg_decompress_struct) and
 * refuses to run if it disagrees, so a wrong header fails safely but silently.
 *
 * Decoding a 3000x3000 cover on a 56 MB device is not free, so libjpeg's
 * scale_denom does the downscale during decode (it can skip most of the IDCT
 * work), and the result is cached next to the cover as a raw RGB565 blob.
 *
 * Cover art is untrusted input — whatever the podcast host chose to publish —
 * and a 3000x3000 *progressive* cover was enough to get hiby_player killed by
 * the OOM killer. Scanline streaming below keeps baseline JPEGs cheap at any
 * size, but progressive decoding cannot stream: jpeg_start_decompress builds
 * the whole coefficient array before it will yield a single line, and
 * scale_denom shrinks only the output, not that array. At 3000x3000x3 that is
 * ~54 MB on a device with about 18 MB free. So the header is checked first and
 * anything whose working set would not fit is declined; the feed loses its
 * thumbnail instead of the player losing its life.
