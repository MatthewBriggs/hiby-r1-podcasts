# -O2, not -Os. This is a decoder: dr_flac's residual and LPC loops are the
# hot path on a 1 GHz in-order MIPS with no SIMD, and -Os deliberately
# suppresses the loop optimisations they depend on to save a few hundred KB
# nobody is short of. The stock player handles 192/24 over USB without
# trouble on this same CPU, so the headroom exists and we were leaving it on
# the floor. Size cost is a one-off; the decode cost is paid continuously.
# -Ivendor: vendor/vorbis/codec.h pulls in <ogg/ogg.h> (Xiph's own header,
# unmodified) as an angle-bracket system include, so vendor/ needs to be on
# the search path for it to resolve to vendor/ogg/ogg.h.
# SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2 (multi-thread mode), not 0: index.c's background
# scanner needs its own SQLite connections, used concurrently with library.c's
# g_db on the UI thread. Multi-thread mode is safe for that -- a single
# connection still may never be shared across threads, which nothing here
# does -- whereas 0 strips all internal mutexing and makes any two threads
# touching SQLite at the same time undefined, even on different connections.
