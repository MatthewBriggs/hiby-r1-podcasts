/* index.c — a track-detail cache this app owns.
 *
 * Every album open used to re-derive track number, disc number and duration
 * live: tag_track_number()/tag_disc_number() each opened the file
 * independently (fixed since, see tags.c), and duration is unpopulated for
 * ~99.7% of the stock index (R28) so audio_probe_dur_ms() opened it again.
 * Nothing was ever cached, so this cost was paid on *every* open, forever,
 * scaling with track count -- a 183-track box set meant hundreds of
 * synchronous file opens just to draw its tracklist.
 *
 * This owns a small SQLite database of its own (never the stock read-only
 * one library.c reads) and a background thread that walks the library once,
 * reading each file's tags exactly once, so a later album open is a plain
 * SQL lookup keyed by path. A row is valid only while its stored mtime
 * matches the file's current mtime -- a retag or replace just falls back to
 * a live read (unchanged from today) until the next scan pass catches it.
 *
 * Threading: build.sh compiles SQLite with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2 (multi-thread
 * mode) specifically for this file -- safe for different connections to be
 * used concurrently from different threads, unsafe only if a single
 * connection were shared across threads, which nothing here does. The
 * scanner thread opens its own connections (one read-only to the stock DB,
 * one read-write to this file); index_lookup() below opens and reuses its
 * own separate read-only connection, called only from the UI thread, same
 * as every other database access in this app.
