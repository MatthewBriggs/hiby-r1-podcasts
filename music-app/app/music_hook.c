/* music_hook.c — a music and radio app on the R1's About launcher tile.
 *
 * LD_PRELOAD into hiby_player, re-point a launcher tile's callback at us, and

 *
 *   tile     about, callback slots 0x00892150 and 0x00892570 (the tile shows
 *            up twice in hiby_player's own data, both patched so it's caught
 *            wherever the launcher reads it from)
 *   cave     0x00760800, a zeroed run in .rodata
 *
 * This app used to live on the Stream media tile, chain-loading a separate
 * standalone Podcasts app onto the About tile from its own constructor.
 * Podcasts is built into this app directly now (see podcast.c), so that
 * second app was retired and this hook moved onto the About tile in its
 * place -- Stream media is untouched and back to its stock behaviour.
 *
 * Addresses were read straight out of hiby_player rather than found by
 * scanning a live device: tile records hold their name as an inline string at
 * +0x00 and the callback at +0x48, so a new firmware can be re-derived in
 * seconds. See the tile-table notes in the repo.

 *
 * The second is that it looked actively dangerous. Every lock and unlock ran
 * wifi_off.sh / wifi_on.sh, which kill wpa_supplicant and take the interface
 * down and up -- far more driver state-cycling than stock ever does, and
 * hiby_player polls the same driver throughout (there is a
 * `wpa_cli -i wlan0 signal_poll` child of it in the process list). After a
 * session of this the Broadcom driver wedged: dhd_dpc spinning at 97% of the
 * CPU in kernel space, load average 22, zero idle. Because dhd sits on the
 * SDIO bus the SD card shares, that starved storage too -- `sync` hung, an
 * exFAT mount took 492 seconds, and the device could not complete a reboot or
 * even `reboot -f`. It needed the battery pulling.
 *
 * Not proven to be the cause, but it is the one thing here doing something
 * stock does not, and the saving no longer justifies the suspicion. See BG27.
