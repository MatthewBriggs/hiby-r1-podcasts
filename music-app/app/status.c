/* R64: /etc/init.d/S80_bt_init backgrounds /usr/bin/bt_init and returns
 * immediately, so this app's own startup (S92, right after S80 in the boot
 * sequence) runs *in parallel* with bt_init's ~15+ second sequence, not
 * after it -- and that sequence's very last command is an explicit
 * `bt-adapter --set Powered Off`, added upstream so stock firmware starts
 * with Bluetooth off until its own UI turns it on. A plain "on" call made
 * during that window (R64's boot-time restore, when it wants Bluetooth back
 * on) would very likely land *before* that trailing Off and then get
 * silently overwritten by it moments later -- reported live as the restore
 * never taking, every time, on a real reboot.
 *
 * bt_init itself touches /tmp/bt_init_ok as its last line, after that Off,
 * so waiting for that file first and then re-asserting "on" always comes
 * after, not before. Capped at 20s (bt_init's own sleeps alone add up to
 * about 10s) so a firmware or init failure that never creates the file
 * can't hang this forever -- it just falls through to enabling immediately,
 * the same behavior as before this existed. A no-op wait on every call
 * after boot, once the file already exists, so this is safe to leave in
 * st_bt_set() itself rather than only in the boot-restore path: busybox has
 * no `timeout` applet (see bt_pair()'s own history with that), hence the
 * hand-rolled bounded loop rather than wrapping this in one. */
