/* scanner.c — RP6: a library index built by walking the SD card directly.
 *
 * library.c reads /usr/data/usrlocal_media.db, hiby_player's own stock
 * index -- fine while hiby_player is still around to build and maintain it,
 * but a dead end for the "replace hiby_player" plan (BACKLOG.md RP6): once
 * hiby_player is gone, nothing ever scans the card again and the library
 * stays frozen at whatever it last saw.
 *
 * This is that replacement scanner. It owns a database of its own --
 * SCANNER_DB_PATH, never the stock file -- shaped with the same MEDIA_TABLE
 * name and column set the stock one has, so every one of library.c's 15
 * existing raw-SQL query sites can run against it completely unchanged;
 * see lib_open()'s own comment for how the two databases are chosen
 * between. Rows carry the columns those queries actually read (name, path,
 * format, bit, sample_rate, bit_rate, end_time, artist, album,
 * album_artist, genre, ctime) plus one this database alone needs, `mtime`,
 * the change-detection key that makes a second pass over an unchanged file
 * a single indexed lookup rather than a re-read of its tags.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT touch the stock database or run while it's live and
 * populated: while hiby_player still owns the card's index, this scanner
 * building its own in parallel would just be wasted SD I/O for a database
 * library.c won't prefer over the stock one anyway (see lib_open()). It is
 * still reachable today, same as index.c's "Rebuild library index" row --
 * useful for testing this file ahead of actually dropping hiby_player, and
 * harmless meanwhile: it only ever writes to SCANNER_DB_PATH, never to
 * anything hiby_player itself reads.
 *
 * Two traps this scanner does NOT reproduce, on purpose:
 *  - The stock database's values arrive NUL-terminated *inside the string*
 *    (see library.c's own header comment). That is a quirk of however
 *    hiby_player's own scanner encodes strings, not something SQLite or
 *    this app's queries require -- copy_text() strips it defensively but
 *    doesn't need it present. Rows written here carry plain, cleanly
 *    NUL-terminated strings, which copy_text() handles identically (its
 *    trim loop just finds nothing to trim).
 *  - Track number: the stock schema drops it entirely (real_path()'s own
 *    header comment: "no track number... only track_gain and track_peak").
 *    Ordering is recovered elsewhere, from the filename or the file's own
 *    tags (track_no_from_path(), tag_read()) -- this database doesn't need
 *    to carry one either.
 *  - end_time: populated by the stock scanner only for a cue-sheet split
 *    track sharing one physical file across several rows (see
 *    tracks_query()'s own comment) -- an ordinary track is left -1
 *    indefinitely even there. This scanner never splits a file across rows,
 *    so every row here carries -1, unconditionally.
 *
 * Threading and SQLite pragmas below mirror index.c's own scan_worker
 * exactly, including the SD-card exFAT caution in its header comment --
 * this file writes to UBIFS (/usr/data) for the identical reason index.c's
 * database does, not the card itself.
